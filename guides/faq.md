# Frequently Asked Questions

## Can I get banned for using mods(cosmetics)?

The short answer is technically yes, but practically no. The long answer is that the ToS of these games state that anything that modifies the game memory and even third-party software can be considered a bannable offense. These clauses are there to protect the game from cheaters and hackers first and foremost. However, the developers of these games have not taken any action against modders in the past, and it is unlikely they will in the future.

The fact that there are over 300,000 active players using mods and no one has been banned yet is a testament to this. The developers have even acknowledged the modding community in the past, so it is safe to say that you won't be banned for using mods.

### What about the banwave on HSR release?

The banwave was targeting resellers of accounts, rerolls, and cheaters. In the process, their anticheat system misflagged things like Linux devices, FPS unlockers, Reshade, and even some input device software. There have been users who happened to be using mods when this happened, and the paranoia got the best of them. After checking every report in detail, we concluded that in all cases there were other tools or software that could have triggered the ban.

## Do I need to hide my UID?

This is a big misconception. Most people in the modding scene will recommend hiding your UID for security reasons as if to hide from the developers. Realistically, the developers have way easier ways to track if someone is using mods or not. In fact, they know exactly which accounts do and which don't. There are claims that content creators partnered with the developers might be banned via their UID. They would likely be identified by their online handle way faster than their UID, so this is once more a fallacy.

The only valid reason to hide your UID is for aesthetic reasons or to avoid people from sending you coop requests. In which case, you will easily find mods that help you hide your UID. You are one Google search away from finding them!

## Can coop players see my mods?

No. Mods are client-side only, and there is no networking functionality built into them. The only way for someone to see your mods is by sharing screenshots, videos, or streaming.

## A mod requires I install another .dll file, should I?

It is a massive security risk to do so. A .dll file can execute arbitrary code on your device and do as it pleases within. If you are unsure about a mod, ask in the modding community or the modder themselves. If you are still unsure, don't install it.

There are old guides recommending replacing the .dll that comes with the launcher, and some even worse recommend putting it in the game folder. This will likely get you banned because it counts as modifying the game files (by adding content to their directory). Ignore said guides and make sure to always install mods in a separate folder. If a mod requires you to download a random .dll, request the author to amend this, and if you paid for said mod, file a refund with your credit card.

## Will modding be possible outside of PC?

The tools used for modding on PC are not designed to work on any other device. In fact, it is Windows-only software. There are no plans to port the tools to other devices, and even if there were, the process would be long and tedious, probably taking several years of development.
