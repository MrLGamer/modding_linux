## Etiquette for modding

- Always read the mod description and requirements before downloading. In some cases mods depend on other works from the community to work, often refered as libraries, requirements or dependencies. Follow the instructions that come with them to properly configure them prior to installing your mod. Otherwise you might endup with a broken looking mod.
- Always endorse/like the mods you like. This is the best way to show your appreciation to the mod author and to incentivize them into making more of that kind.
- Beware of your security. Mods for 3dm games are distributed in compressed files and contain `.dds` images for texturing, `.ini` files for configurations, `.buf` files to store the 3d models into and ocassionally `.hlsl` for custom shaders. Any other file type should be treated with caution, because it might be some form of malware. The prior mentioned files can't be infected with a virus due to their primitive nature.

## Paid content and piracy

In the communities mentioned across this website paywalling is forbidden. In order to monetize content, mod authors rely on donations, patreon and other forms of crowdfunding. The use of early access content is the more acceptable form of monetization, as it allows the mod author to get some revenue from their work, while the community can still enjoy the mod openly and for free after a certain period of time(usually up to 30 days from initial release).

The use of websites to circumvent these early access periods is seen as a form of piracy and frown upon on the community. It is important to respect the work of the mod authors and the rules they set for their content after all is the product of their hard labor.

## Closed communites

There are a fair share of websites, forums and closed Discord servers or QQ groups that distrubute mods in closed circles with their own set of rules and customs. Sadly these tend to be quite hard to get into and closed to foreign audiences. At times they lock their content behind paywalls or passwords that can have cultural connotation or subtleties to keep the community tight knit. It is important to respect these communities and their rules, as they help keep the modding scene alive in their own way. Requesting others to share content from these communities is seen as disrespectful and can lead to a ban from their community and a bad reputation in the modding scene.

Beware that some of these are scams and seek to charge an entry fee or a subscription to access their content. Always be cautious and do your research before joining any of these communities. In general we advice against paying for mods that will never be public because they tend to be parts of these scams.
At times these communities are closed because the mods they distribute are stolen from other authors and reposted behind a paywall. Not only you can potentially find them for free from their original authors but also you are supporting a thief by paying for their content. When in doubt simply reach out to others in the [discord server](https://discord.gg/agmg) for advice.
