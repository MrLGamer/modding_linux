# Mod Managers

Due to technical complexity making a mod manager that can account for all possible ways a mod maker would craft their creation is near impossible. Hence mod managers need to be very sophisticated to even somewhat function. Games like Skyrim or Fallout don't have this issue due to the file organization required for their mods to function making them easy to manage. 3DMigoto makes it hard to identify resources and group them logically. Hence there is a low abundance in mod managers and most are (at the time of writing this guide) in quite a primitive state.

Therefore, I recommend to make a backup of your mod folder before even testing a mod manager. Most of them mess with your file organization and some even edit your configuration files to the point that they can accidentally break the mod outside of the envoirament they created. 

## I am no coward. Give me those links

Alright alright, disclaimers aside mod managers are quite interesting projects and they need more support and aid to polish their work. I will be linking the ones I am aware of without much explanation of their functionality both because they explain it in their own links and because their functionalities are always evolving.
