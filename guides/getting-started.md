You might be wondering how can it be this simple, matter of fact it is! The launcher will automatically download and install the necessary configurations for you, so you can focus on playing the game and adquiring the mods of your preference.

## Installing your first mod

1. Head over to your modding site of choice. We recommend [gamebanana.com](https://gamebanana.com) but sites like [nexusmods.com](https://nexusmods.com) or [loverslab.com](https://loverslab.com) are also good sources.
    - [GI mods](https://gamebanana.com/mods/1)
    - [WW mods](https://gamebanana.com/mods/1)
    - [HSR mods](https://gamebanana.com/mods/1)
    - [ZZZ mods](https://gamebanana.com/mods/1)
2. Browse the site and download the mod you want to install. They tend to be in a `.zip` file(or similar) with all the necessary files inside.
3. Open the launcher, click on the "Open Mods folder"

5. Head over to your game and press f10 to hot reload the mods.

Is worth mentioning that some mods might require you to download other mods to function or even install them in specific folders, make sure to read the mod's description to know if that's the case.

::: danger
Be mindful of your security when downloading mods, always make sure to download from trusted sources. Mods are only composed of `.ini` files, textures and 3dmodels of `.buf` extension. If any mod asks you to download an executable file(`.exe`) or `.dll` , it's likely a virus. There are exceptions to this rule such as tools or fixes that require `.py` or `.exe` files to run.
